                <h3>Terrariums</h3>
                      <p>
                        A terrarium is like an aquarium, but for plants instead of fish.
                         It is made in just about any glass container.
                          It is planted to look like a miniature garden or forest enclosed in its own little world.
                         You can easily make a beautiful terrarium yourself.
                         <li> How do you take care of a terrarium?</li>
                          For moss terrariums, they need a light water once a week.
                           For plant-heavy terrariums, they need to be watered twice a week.
                            Use a spray gun or a terrarium water bottle that has a pointy nozzle to help guide the water.
                             Make sure your terrarium is not in direct sunlight to avoid the plants over heating and drying out.
                             Simply put, a terrarium is a glass vessel that contains plants and soil, creating a miniature ecosystem.
                              These low-maintenance indoor gardens are an attractive way to incorporate plants into either a home or office setting while providing a beautiful aesthetic and many other advantages.
                              <li> Are Terrariums Gaining Popularity?</li>
                              Terrariums were incredibly popular in the 1970â€™s and then slowly faded into the background.
                               In the last handful of years though, they are gaining popularity again for a myriad of reasons, but this time as sleek, modernized versions of the iconic, large displays of the past.
                               It is thought this current rise in popularity goes hand in hand with an overall increased awareness of health and well being.
                                People are realizing the immense benefits that nature, plants, and green spaces have on their physical and mental wellness.
                                 To facilitate this connection when life and work keep you from getting outside, indoor plants provide the same perks.
                                 Choosing to garden in a terrarium provides you with an incredibly low-maintenance way to garden indoors.
                                  Terrariums are fairly self-contained and self-sufficient, needing little care.
                                   Depending on the type you choose to have it may be weeks or months between basic tasks such as watering.
